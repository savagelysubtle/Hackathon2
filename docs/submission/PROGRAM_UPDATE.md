**Status**: ✅ **EXCELLENT NEWS!**

## 📅 **Key Updates from Warden Team**

### **1. Deadline Extended!** ⏰

- **First Month Deadline**: **Mid-December**
- **Your Status**: Plenty of time to polish!
- **Advantage**: You're ready NOW, can improve over time

### **2. Keep Building After Submission!** 🚀

> "You can keep making commits. This is your project so keep building!"

**What This Means**:

- ✅ Submit early to qualify
- ✅ Keep improving your agent
- ✅ Polish UX for monetization
- ✅ No pressure to be "perfect" on Day 1

### **3. Monetization Coming Soon!** 💰

> "We're preparing to launch Warden Studio soon, so you should be able to publish and monetize your agent in the Warden App when that happens."

**Opportunity**:

- 📱 **13 million users** in Warden App
- 💵 **USDC payments** from users
- 🎯 **Direct monetization** for your agent
- ⚡ **Better UX = more willing to pay**

### **4. Simplified Community Submission!** 📝

> "I suggest that you use your own repo to host your agent and open a PR to the main README.md file so we can link to your repo. That way you can keep working on your agent without submitting PRs to us."

**New Process**:

1. Open PR to [community-agents](https://github.com/warden-protocol/community-agents) README
2. Link to YOUR repo (https://github.com/savagelysubtle/Hackathon2)
3. Keep building on YOUR repo (no more PRs needed)
4. Full control over your codebase

**Old Process** (❌ NOT needed):

- ~~Fork agent-kit-examples~~
- ~~Submit PRs for every change~~
- ~~Wait for approval~~

### **5. LangGraph Confirmed as Only Rule!** ✅

> "The only rule is to use LangGraph until we enable full A2A support for community agents."

**Your Status**: ✅ **FULLY COMPLIANT!**

- Using StateGraph ✅
- Using Annotation ✅
- Using MemorySaver ✅
- Using ToolNode ✅
